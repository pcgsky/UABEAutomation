# UABEAvalonia Automation Script

A simple C# script to automate my modding workflow using [UABEAvalonia](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE).  
This script streamlines the repetitive steps of replacing unity assets. I could have added a CLI to the original project but I'm dumb and I bricked certain parts of the project. Debugging took too long. This was the lazy way. 

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6 SDK or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)  
- [UABEAvalonia](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA/releases/tag/v8)

### Setup
- Paste path of UABEAvalonia.exe to config.json

### Runaa
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
